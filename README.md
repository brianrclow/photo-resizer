# photo-resizer
This go program will resize down all photos in a specified directory to around or under 400Kb. This has been adapted from: https://github.com/nfnt/resize to allow for scalable adornment of photos.

How to run:

1. Drop all photos that need to be resized into the input folder
2. Make sure that the filepath is correct in the program for input and output
3. Run "go run main.go"
4. Grab all the processed photos from the output folder


Expect about 100 to take a little over a minute to run.
